# DesignReplay - Nova VR ðŸš€

**An ongoing series of website section designs, each inspired by incredible existing designs and reimagined with my unique touch.**

This project is part of the **DesignReplay** series, where I recreate and customize landing pages inspired by standout designs. **Nova VR** focuses on a sleek, interactive hero section for a VR product line, drawing inspiration from the clean and minimalistic design of [Icon Golf Carts USA](https://icongolfcartsusa.com/).
